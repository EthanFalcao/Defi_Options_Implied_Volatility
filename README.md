# Optimizing Options Models for Cryptocurrency

Welcome to the Optimizing Options Models for Cryptocurrency repository. This project is focused on developing and refining mathematical models for pricing Bitcoin options in the over-the-counter (OTC) market.

## Introduction

Options are financial derivatives that give the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time period. The cryptocurrency market, while relatively new, presents unique opportunities for the application of options. This project aims to create accurate and reliable models that reflect the complexity and volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

## Project Structure

- `data`: This directory contains datasets used in the project.
- `Data-Preprocessing.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook for preprocessing the data to be used in the models.
- `EDA.ipynb`: An exploratory data analysis notebook to investigate the datasets and glean insights.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethanfaclao/Optimizing-Options-Models-Crypto.git
